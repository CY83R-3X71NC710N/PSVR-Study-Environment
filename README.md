# PSVR-Study-Environment
Custom PSVR study environment mp4 generator

# Issue
PSVR has absolutely no study environments, I found this to be an issue when I wanted to study in VR therefore I created this project allowing you to create your very own custom studyspace with custom learning resources using PSVR.

Simply find a 360 VR study environment you want to use on youtube, download using youtubedl then get a recording of the resources you wish to study in mp4 format. Provide both of these to the python script.

# What exactly does this project do?

What this project does is take two mp4 files, the study environment and the learning resources you recorded on your computer. I take these and merge them together, the learning resource goes in the center of the study environment. After we generate the new mp4 file you should put the file on a USB stick and use PSVR media player with VR option ticked on in order to study in your study environment, you can pause/play/fast-forward as needed to get the learning resources in your head.
